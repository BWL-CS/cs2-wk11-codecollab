# Java Template for CS2 PROJECTS

This repository provides a simple **template** with `Java` starter code, intended for projects assigned through GitHub Classroom. For **project instructions** and **helpful resources**, refer to our course website: üìñ [JavaDocs](https://coderina.dev/javadocs/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _DO NOT modify the following files:_ `.devcontainer`, `.vscode`

### üíª Codespaces Instructions
1. Click the green `<> Code` button in the top right area above the list of files
2. Select the `Codespaces` tab and click `Open new Codespace on main`
3. Wait for the Codespace to set up (_it will take some time because VSCode extensions are being installed_)
4. After the extensions load, you can open `Main.java` from the **File Explorer** menu on the left, and now you're ready to code!
5. Always make sure to `commit changes` before closing a Codespace!
